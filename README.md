## AutomaticProjectCreation
This is a simple python script you can use to automate the process of starting a new programming project. This is the same project which was previously made in shell. You can find it [here.](https://github.com/Imira-S-R/SimpleAutomaticProjectCreationTool)

## What does this do ?
When you run this script it will ask you for the Project Name, Author and The File Extension and it will create a new directory for it and create a file with the give file extension and add the project name and author as a comment to the file based on the extension and finally mark the file as executable. Please note that adding a comment in different programming languages are different therefore it will take some time to add support for all the programming languages. Currently it supports .py, .dart.
